# TCC---EMG-and-Interface


This project is about an user interface that displays, at the same time, a pre-recorded electromiographic signal and a graphic interface controlled by this signal.

The strutcure that this project accesses was created by Carlos Magno at his doctoral research and for ethical reasons any biological signal cannot be displayed here. 

So, in a nutshell, all the codes here were created to take a specific .txt file (from the structure mentioned above, according to the chosen volunteer, section, protocol and repetition) and convert them in a graphic interface (since this data contains the x, y positions from the comopter cursor, controlled by a state machine), temporarily synchronized with the EMG signal that controlls the cursor movement.
